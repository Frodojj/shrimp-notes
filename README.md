# shrimp-notes

Hello, world! This is going to be a note taking app. The initial purpose is to
help with note taking during my jiu-jitsu classes and math classes. Currently
uses svg.js to help manage making svg elements, but this can be factored out
easily.

No matter where you go, there you are. Think about that, and have a good day!
